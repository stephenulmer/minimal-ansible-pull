# minimal-ansible-pull

## Purpose

This is very minimal to allow new users of ansible-pull to have a icross-platform "Hello World" style
playbook. It leaves a small artifact: it places a file in /tmp/server-info.txt with some values replaced
by simple Ansible facts discovered on the target system.
